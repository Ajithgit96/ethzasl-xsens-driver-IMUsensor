As this is a old driver a minor change is necessary to make it compatible with tf2.

Line number 7 in launch/xsens_driver.launch file must be changed from 

<arg name="frame_id" default="/imu" doc="frame id of the IMU"/>

to 

<arg name="frame_id" default="imu" doc="frame id of the IMU"/>

/ must be removed infront of "imu" as per naming rules of tf2. This change is already made in this project.

Note: The same frame id name "imu" must be used in urdf configuration in cartographer project for 3D mapping.
